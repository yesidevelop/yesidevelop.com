Greetings, fellow adventurers! I am Ali Mehdi, and I am DevOps specialist, skilled in many differnet cloud technogologies. I want to share my experience of becoming the DevOps person from developer background. Hope this will help you also if you want to achieve new heights

### 2013

I started my career in 2013 as wordpress developer, plunging into depth of backend / frontend development and exciting projects on jquery / javascript. I got to know about php development. It was a good year as I was a fresher and starter.


### 2014-17

But suddenly I realised that Workdpress Development is very basic for me so I started to learn different technologies like MongoDB, Laravel etc

I was mostly the part of web development, with the api development, testing, implementation. Worked with different clients and helped them grow

### 2017-20

As my experience grew, I started working on server side with AWS. Got AWS Developer Associate certification. Worked with high profile companies. Worked on EC2, RDS, EFS, EBS and S3, Cloudformation

I did my first AWS certification 🥇 Developer Associate in 2017

### 2020-Present

I further sharpend my skills by learning kubernetes deployments, infrastructure provisioning, IAAC, boto3.

I worked on python to develop AI apps. Worked on Django, Tensorflow, Flask and other apps

I then did 🥇 CKAD certification in 2021

### Summary

Still a long way to go. Hoping for the best!!!
